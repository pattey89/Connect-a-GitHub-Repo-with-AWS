## Introducing Today's Project!

In this project I will set up a Git repository for my web app's code. This is Project TWO in my seven days devops challenge. By the end of this project, the code that I will write for my Java web app will be stored securely in Github.

### Key tools and concepts

Services I used were Github, VScode, Amazon EC2 and keypair.  Key concepts I learnt include setting up Git repository, the difference between Git and Github , the commands for staging, saving and pushing changes to my code. I also learnt about upstreaming repositories and setting a remote origin and branches.

### Project reflection

This project took me approximately 2 hours including practice time. It was most rewarding to set up README that ties the entire repository together and seeing my code pop up in my Github repository. The most challenging part was learning all this git commands.

I did this project today to learn more about Git and Github. I am excited to have a repository that stores my webapp repository code.

This project is part two of a series of DevOps projects where I'm building a CI/CD pipeline! I'll be working on the next project tomorrow!

## Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system, which means it's used to track changes that I made to my code.It's also incredibly helpful for collaboration. With Git you can see who made WHAT change and the hand over from development to deployment is a lot smoother when everyone is looking at the same shared repository of code. I install Git using the commands 
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install git -y


GitHub is a place for engineers to store and share their code and projects online. It's called GitHub because it uses Git to manage your projects' version history. Even though your code is on a cloud server like EC2, GitHub helps you use Git and see your file changes in a more user-friendly way. It's just like how using an IDE (VSCode) makes editing code easy.

GitHub is also especially useful in situation where you're working in teams and need to share your updates and reviews to a shared code base.
